# 3 Discrete Random Variables

**We need good data and good statistical thinking in order to make good predictions.**

## 3.1 Random variables

**Definition of Random Variable:**

Given an experiment with sample space $S$, a *random variable* is a function from the sample space $S$ to the real numbers $\mathbb{R}$.
