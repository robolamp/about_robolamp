# 1. Probability and counting
## 1.2.Sample Spaces and Pebble World

The **sample space**  $S$  of an experiment = set of all possible outcomes of the experiment.
Can be finite or infinite.

An **event** $A$  is a subset of the $S$, and we say that  $A$ **occurred** if the actual outcome is in  $A$.

not A = $A^c$

Example:

$A, B \subseteq S$

$A \cup B$ if and only if at least one of $A, B$ occurs.

$A \cap B$ if and only if both of $A, B$.

De Morgan's laws:

$(A \cup B)^c = A^c \cap B^c$ | $A$ OR $B$ not occur = $A$ not occur AND $B$ not occur
$(A \cap B)^c = A^c \cup B^c$ | $A$ AND $B$ not occur = $A$ not occur OR $B$ not occur
