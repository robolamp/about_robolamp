# 4 Continuous Random Variables

Together, discrete and continuous approaches form a powerful framework
for modeling the world.

## 4.1 Probability density function

Continuous RVs!

An RV has a *continuous distribution* if its CDF is differentiable. Endpoints of CDF may be continuous but not differentiable. A continuous RV is a RV with a continuous distribution.

For a continuous RV $X$ with CDF $F$, the PDF of $X$ is derivative $f$ of the CDF: $f(x)=F'(x)$

The support of $X$: all $x$ where $f(x)>0$.

The PDF is kinda similar to PMF, but for PDF quantity of $f(x)$ **is not a probability**. To obtaion the probability, we need to **integrate** PDF.

 We can be carefree about including or excluding endpoints as above for continuous RVs, but we must not be careless about this for discrete RVs.

Valid PDF of a continuous RV:

1. Nonnegative: $f(x) \geq 0$
2. Integrates to 1: $\int^{\infty}_{-\infty}f(x)dx=1$

Example: logistic distribution.

$X \sim$ Logistic.

CDF:

$$
F(x) = \frac{e^x}{1+e^x}, x \in \mathbb{R}
$$

PDF:

$$
F(x) = \frac{e^x}{(1+e^x)^2}, x \in \mathbb{R}
$$

To find $P(-2<X<2)$, we need to integrate PDF from $-2$ to $2$:

$$
P(-2<X<2) = \int^2_{-2}\frac{e^x}{(1+e^x)^2} = F(2)-F(-2) \approx 0.76
$$

Or $P(âˆ’2<X<2)$ is indicated by the shaded area under the PDF and the height of the curly brace on the CDF.

## 4.2 Uniform distribution

A continuous RV $U$ has the *Uniform distribution* $X \sim Unif(a, b)$ on the interval $(a, b)$ if its PDF is:

$$
f(x)=\frac{1}{b-a}\ \forall a < x < b,\\
f(x)=0\ otherwise
$$

The CDF is the accumulated area under the PDF:

$$
F(x)=0\ \forall x \leq a,\\
F(x)=\frac{x-a}{b-a}\ a < x < b,\\
F(x)=1\ \forall x \geq b.\\
$$

$Unif(0,1)$ is the standard Uniform.

For Uniform distributions, *probability is proportional to length.*

Location-scale transformation.

The RV $Y$ has been obtained as a *location-scale transformation* of $X$ if $Y=\sigma X + \mu$. $\mu$ controls the location and $\sigma$ controls the scale.

**Warning**: if $Y$ is a linear function of $X$, the Uniformity is preserved, but if $Y$ is defined as a *nonlinear* transformation of $X$, $Y$ will not be Uniform.

**Warning**: When using location-scale transformations, the shifting and scaling should be applied to the *random variables* themselves, not to their PDFs.

## 4.3 Universality of the Uniform distribution

Given a $Unif(0,1)$ RV, we can construct an RV with *any continuous distribution we want*.

Other names of the universality of Uniform:
 * probability integral transform,
 * inverse transform sampling,
 * the quantile transformation,
 * the fundamental theorem of simulation.

**Theorem:**

$F$ is a CDF which is continuous function and strictly increasing on the support of distribution. This ensures that the inverse function $F^{-1}$ exists as function $(0, 1) \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$. Results:

1. Let $U \sim Unif(0,1)$ and $X=F^{-1}(U)$. Then $X$ is an RV with CDF $F$.
2. Let $X$ be an RV with CDF $F$. Then $F(X) \sim Unif(0,1)$.

What this theorem is saying about?

Fist part: Since $F^{-1}$ is a function (**quantile function**), $U$ is a RV, and a function of RV is RV, $F^{-1}(U)$ is a RV; universality of the Uniform says its CDF is $F$.

Second part: reverse direction!
Starting from RV $X$ whose CDF is $F$ and then creating RV $Unif(0,1)$.
Universality of the Uniform says that the distribution of $F(X)$ is Uniform on $(0,1)$.

Warning: potential notational collusion!

$F(x)=P(X\leq x)$ by definition, but $F(X)=P(X\leq X)=1$ is incorrect by definition.
Rather, we should first find an expression for the CDF as a function of $x$, then replace $x$  with $X$ to obtain a random variable. For example, if the CDF of $X$ is $F(x)=1-e^{-1}$ for $x>0$, then $F(X)=1-e^{-X}$.
