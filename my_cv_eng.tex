\cventry{March~2018 -- Now}{Software engineer}{Yandex Self-Driving Cars}{Moscow}{}{
\begin{itemize}
\item Sensor diagnostics software (ROS, C++, Python, NumPy):
  I created simple data quality checking software modules for cameras and LiDARs.
\item Traffic lights recognition software (ROS, C++, Python, NumPy, TensorFlow, Keras).
  \begin{itemize}
  \item I worked on improvement of traffic lights recognition and tracking pipeline,
  \item learning data mining, pre-processing and datasets preparation,
  \item created, learned and deployed multiple iterations of deep neural networks,
  which are working now at hundreds of self-driving cars made by Yandex.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}}
